## üìë Presentation  
Working on cleaning the presentation[^1] for public sharing ‚Äî no promises.  

[^1]: The presentation was created using AI tools, including ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini for outline, fact-checking, references, and demo suggestions. Gamma.app was used for the initial PowerPoint layout and image creation.

## ü§ñ AI Concepts  

### Core Technologies  
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** The engines behind ChatGPT and friends. They‚Äôve read a ton of text and can spin out human-like answers by predicting what comes next.  
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Think of two AIs playing cat-and-mouse ‚Äî one makes fakes, the other tries to catch them. Over time, the fakes get so good they fool us too.  
- **Synthetic Data:** Made-up data that looks real. Super handy when you don‚Äôt have enough examples or can‚Äôt use the real thing for privacy reasons.  
- **Neural Networks:** Loosely inspired by brains. Layers of little ‚Äúnodes‚Äù passing signals around until patterns pop out.  
- **Transformers:** The special recipe that made modern AI take off. They let models look at whole chunks of information at once instead of word by word.  
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Fancy name for ‚Äúopen-book AI.‚Äù The model pulls from your docs or a database so it‚Äôs not just making things up from memory.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Trial-and-error learning. The AI tries things, gets rewards or penalties, and improves over time. Think of training a puppy, but digital.  
- **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback):** A twist on RL where *humans* give the feedback. People rank answers, and the AI learns which ones we like. 

### Key Concepts  
- **Hallucination:** When AI sounds confident but is flat-out wrong.  
- **Prompt Engineering:** Talking to AI in just the right way to get what you want. Feels a bit like learning a new language.  
- **Fine-tuning:** Taking a general-purpose model and teaching it a new specialty, like giving a chef lessons in sushi-making.  
- **Tokenization:** Breaking text into bite-sized chunks (words or pieces of words) so computers can handle them.  
- **Embeddings:** Turning words or ideas into math-y coordinates so the AI can ‚Äúfeel‚Äù what‚Äôs close in meaning.  

### Applications  
- **Agentic AI:** Not just answering questions, but actually *doing things* ‚Äî booking your trip, organizing your files, running small projects.  
- **Computer Vision:** Your phone unlocking with Face ID, or a car spotting a stop sign. That‚Äôs AI ‚Äúseeing.‚Äù  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Basically, AI understanding and generating language ‚Äî from translating Spanish menus to writing your emails.  
- **Multimodal AI:** A model that can juggle text, images, audio, maybe even video all at once.  
- **Edge AI:** AI running right on your phone or camera, so it‚Äôs faster and more private ‚Äî no cloud required.  

### Ethical & Practical Considerations  
- **AI Alignment:** Teaching AI to follow human values ‚Äî in spirit, not just letter of the law.  
- **Model Collapse:** When AIs keep learning from AI-written stuff, and the quality slowly drifts downhill.  
- **Bias in AI:** Garbage in, garbage out ‚Äî if the data‚Äôs biased, the AI will be too.  
- **Explainable AI (XAI):** Peeking under the hood so we know *why* the AI said what it said.  
- **Constitutional AI:** Giving the AI a moral compass baked right into its training.
